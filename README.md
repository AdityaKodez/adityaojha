# hey, i'm aditya

this is my personal portfolio. i decided to open source it cause i believe in learning by doing.

i ship production ready saas mvps for early stage founders. usually takes me 2-4 weeks. i like moving fast and keeping things effective.

take a look around or fork it if you want.

## the stack

built this using the stuff i use everyday

- **next.js 16** (app router)
- **tailwind css v4** + **shadcn ui**
- **typescript**
- **motion** for animations

## run it locally

clone the repo and install dependencies 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdityaKodez/adityaojha.git
cd adityaojha
npm install
npm run dev
```

go to http://localhost:3000 and check it out.

## contact
